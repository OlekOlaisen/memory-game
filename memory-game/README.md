- **High Score**: Saves your best attempt count in local storage
- **Victory Screen**: Win screen appears when all cards are matched
- **Game Restart**: Option to restart the game at any time
- **Main Menu**: Start the game or exit from the main menu 
- **Exit Confirmation**: Dialog box appears before quitting an active game
- **Responsive UI**: Works on both desktop and mobile screens

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and better developer experience
- **Vite**: For fast development and hot reloading
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist high scores between sessions
